# Forehead Subcutaneous Vein Pattern and Periocular Biometric Pattern (FSVP-PBP) Database

## Characteristics of FSVP-PBP Database
This database consists of images of the forehead and periocular region of faces of 200 subjects in NIR range of the electromagnetic spectrum.  It was created as part of the paper titled, "A Portable Biometrics System Based on Forehead Subcutaneous Vein Pattern and Periocular Biometric Pattern" published in Volume 22, Issue 7 of the "IEEE Sensors Journal" and helps in research on biometric systems based on subcutaneous vein pattern. The salient features of the FSVP-PBP database can be outlined as follows:

1. The images were taken in low light conditions under an infra-red light source at 850nm wavelength using a Raspberry Pi NoIR camera.

2. The images were taken at a distance of 4 to 6 cm from the camera.

3. The images are the raw grayscale images acquired from the camera. The region of interest selection can be done using the method mentioned in the base paper.
